# Breast Cancer Classification: Coimbra Data Set
This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Data was collected from 64 patients with breast cancer and 52 healthy controls. There are 10 predictive features, all quantitative, and a binary dependent variable, indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. The predictors are anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in routine blood analysis. Prediction models based on these features can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer. The dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra


The goal of this project is to use anthropometric data to predict whether or not a given patient has breast cancer.
